"""Saving a run in progress.

One slot, overwritten, and consumed the moment it is read.

"Save and quit" rather than "save and reload", and the difference is the whole
design. The file is deleted when the run is picked up again, so quitting in front
of a monster you do not like the look of and coming back to a fresh roll of the
dice is not a thing you can do twice. What it is for is the terminal being closed
and the laptop running out of battery, and the twenty minutes already spent.

The codec is generic: it walks dataclasses by reflection rather than listing
fields, because a list of fields is a list somebody has to remember to add to.
What makes that safe is the round-trip test -- it builds a run with every field
populated and asserts the reloaded one matches field by field, so a field added
and not handled fails there instead of in somebody's saved game.

Two things are *not* generic, and both for the same reason. The hero is stored by
key rather than by value, because heroes are shared frozen templates and a copy
of one would stop being the hero the roster knows. And the turn queue stores
which actor it means rather than a second copy, because a queue full of copies
would fight with the copies in ``enemies`` and neither would be the real one.
