"""What a run teaches you.

Between the shop's permanent upgrades and the floor's own numbers there was
nothing that grew *during* a run except equipment, and equipment arrives in
jumps and is over by floor four. A run is ten floors long and the monsters get
26% harder on each of them; something has to keep up, and it should be the hero.
So kills teach.

A level is a small package of stats -- small enough that three or four of them
are worth about one floor of enemy scaling, which is what makes the curve feel
steady rather than spiky. Health every level, because health is the resource a
run spends and the one the player actually watches; then a rotation of damage,
armour and speed. A run that dies on floor three has had none of the rotation; a
run that reaches floor nine has had all of it a few times.

Automatic rather than a choice. A talent pick needs a screen, a screen needs a
key, and the point of this is that the player notices themselves getting stronger
without having to stop and think about it. The decisions worth stopping for are
in the shop, between runs, where they belong.

Lives in ``game/`` and knows nothing about a terminal: the whole curve is a
function of the kill count, so it can be read off rather than played for.

#: them, which at :data:`KILLS_PER_LEVEL` is level 32. Thirty-one is the last
#: level a run can be *working toward*: the last two kills of a perfect clear
#: have nothing left to teach, and they are only reachable by clearing every
#: floor completely, which no measured run has ever come close to.
