"""Combat resolution.

Deliberately small and legible. One function decides an attack, and it returns a
result object rather than mutating the world silently, so the caller can report
exactly what happened and tests can assert on it.

The hit chance is a flat base nudged by the accuracy/evasion difference. Noxx's
evasion 5 against a ghoul's accuracy 0 puts him at 35% -- being hard to pin down
is half of what makes him work, and the other half is that he gets to attack
more often.

Evasion is worth ten points of hit chance per point, which makes 5 the natural
ceiling for any hero: the floor is 30%, so a sixth point against a monster with
accuracy 0 is partly paid for and not received.
