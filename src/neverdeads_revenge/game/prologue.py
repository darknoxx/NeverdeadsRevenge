"""The prologue and the map legend.

Both live here, in the headless layer, for a reason that is not tidiness: the
legend is generated from :class:`~neverdeads_revenge.world.tiles.Tile` and
``ENEMIES`` and ``ITEMS`` themselves, so a new terrain type, monster or draught
cannot be added without it noticing. Deriving the text rather than writing it
twice is what keeps the sidebar from quietly going stale.

The prologue is plain data. It is shown once per session, before floor 1, and it
is the only place the game's premise is stated in prose -- everything afterwards
has to work without being told again.

It is written in the second person and never names the hero. More heroes are
coming, and a backstory that says "Noxx" is a backstory that has to be rewritten
for each of them; one that says "you" belongs to whoever the player picked.

#: The one line a player must never have to guess at.
#:
#: The prologue asks whether there is a way out; this answers it and says where,
#: in the panel that is on screen at every moment. Kept here rather than in the
#: widget so the width test can measure it like any other legend line.
GOAL_HINT = f"the way out is on floor {ESCAPE_DEPTH}"

#: Shown above the story. The premise in one sentence, for a player skimming.
PROLOGUE_TITLE = "Death is not the end. You were not granted even that."

#: The story, told once per session.
#:
#: The beats are the user's: the battle on Mount Karpas, the falling axe, the
#: blackness that was not peaceful, the body returned, the question of a way out.
#: Everything else is rhythm -- the strongest line here is the shortest ("And the
#: axe."), and it only works because the line before it is long. Nothing explains
#: a mechanic; mechanics are explained when they are met.
#:
#: The line lengths are load-bearing. The pane does not scroll (any key dismisses
#: the screen, so a player who needed to scroll could not), which means the story
#: has to fit a 34-row terminal. Most lines are kept under 70 characters so they
#: occupy one row each; the three that run long do so on purpose, for the beat
#: they land on. ``tests/test_ui.py`` asserts the whole thing still fits.

    "Then black. Not the black behind the eyes -- the black that owns them.",
    "It was not still, and it was not kind. It pressed against you, and it was "
    "pleased.",
    "You cannot say how long. Forever is for people who still have time.",

    "So down, then. Whatever door leads out of this, it is not behind you.",
)

#: The last line on the prologue screen, set apart from the story.
#:
#: The story ends on a decision ("so down, then"); this is the hook that turns the
#: decision into a reason. It answers the question the user's original asked --
#: whether there is a way out of the emptiness -- without doing the arithmetic of
#: which floor, which the sidebar already states exactly.
PROLOGUE_HINT = "There is a way out. It is under everything."


#: Terrain worth explaining. VOID and FLOOR are omitted on purpose: void is
#: "not yet seen", which the player learns from the dimming, and floor is the
#: default the eye assumes. GRASS and WATER are omitted too: they are pure
#: decoration, and the panel has to stay short enough to fit the sidebar without
#: the bottom of it -- the loot and the goal -- falling off the screen.

    ``depth`` matters. Monsters get tougher as the run goes down, and a sidebar
