"""The shop: what coin buys between runs.

Three shelves and a rotating one.

*Supplies* are used up next run -- a draught is health, and health is the one
resource a run can never get enough of.
*Gear* is worn next run: it is permanent within the run, so it is the closest
thing to an upgrade the shop sells without being one.
*Upgrades* are permanent, bought in stacks, and the only thing here that a bad
run cannot take back.
*Wild offers* are the rotating shelf. Two at a time, re-rolled after every run,
each a bargain with a catch. They are the reason to look at the shop even when
you cannot afford the sensible things: a wild offer is never sensible.

Nothing here knows about Textual, and nothing here writes a file. The shop screen
renders what :func:`build_stock` hands it and calls :func:`buy`; the save layer
stores the result. That split is what makes the whole catalogue testable without
a terminal, which for a pile of prices and exceptions is the difference between
tuning it and guessing at it.
