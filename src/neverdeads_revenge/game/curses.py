"""What a chest takes from you.

A chest is a deal: something worth having, and something owed for it. This is the
owed half. The reward stays hidden until the lid is up -- that is what makes it
daring rather than arithmetic -- so the price has to be stated plainly, and
:attr:`Curse.price` is the sentence the player decides on.

A wide record rather than one class per curse. There are six of these, each uses
one or two of the fields, and one table you can take in at a glance beats six
small classes with one method each. The alternative would be a hierarchy built to
express five different kinds of nothing.

Lives in ``game/`` because a curse changes how a run plays. The chest itself
carries only the curse's *key*, so ``world/`` never has to import this.
