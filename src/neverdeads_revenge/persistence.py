"""Persistent player data: what survives between runs.

Milestone 1 writes the file but does not yet fill it. The point of building it
now is that the shape is fixed: later upgrades and hero unlocks only need an
entry in :data:`META_UPGRADES`, not a change to how a run starts.

The save file lives in the XDG data directory so it follows the platform
convention rather than landing in the source tree.
