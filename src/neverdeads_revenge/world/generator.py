Deliberately conservative: rectangular rooms joined by L-shaped corridors, then
validated. Nothing clever, but the output is always fully connected and always
has a reachable exit, which is the property that actually matters for a
roguelite. Exotic generators can come later without touching anything else.

Layout is produced first, then validated, and only then populated. That ordering
means a room can never hold the player, an enemy, and the stairs all at once in a
way that could not possibly connect.
