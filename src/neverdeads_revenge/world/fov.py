"""Field of view.

Visibility is decided by tracing a line from the observer to every candidate
cell inside the view radius.

The obvious implementation -- one Bresenham walk per candidate -- is *almost*
symmetric, but "almost" is not good enough here: measured against real dungeon
floors it disagreed on roughly 10% of visible pairs, which produced the worst
kind of bug for a roguelite, a ghoul that could see you while standing in a cell
you could not see it from. So the symmetric check is explicit rather than
incidental::

    a sees b  <=>  line_clear(a, b) or line_clear(b, a)

The second walk only runs when the first one fails, so the common case stays
cheap.

Corners are permissive: a diagonal step that squeezes between two solid tiles is
blocked only when *both* orthogonal neighbours are opaque. That way you can see
through a one-tile gap without seeing through a wall corner, which is what makes
corridors and doorways read correctly.

Two sets are produced:
    * ``visible``  -- in line of sight right now, drawn at full brightness
    * ``explored`` -- everything ever seen, drawn dimmed
