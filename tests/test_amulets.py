"""Tests for the amulets.

One test per ability, because the abilities are the point: a slot that only ever
added two to a stat would be a third number, and the game already has two of
those. Each one is checked where it happens -- a kill, a drink, a blow landed, a
floor entered -- so a test failing here says which rule broke rather than that
the numbers moved.

The other half of the file is the table itself: every amulet has an item, every
item has an amulet, the two agree on the name, and the two drop tiers partition
the list. An amulet in neither tier is an amulet nobody can ever find.
