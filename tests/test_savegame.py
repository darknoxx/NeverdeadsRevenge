"""Tests for saving a run in progress.

The round trip is the test that matters, and it is written to be *exhaustive*
rather than illustrative: it builds a run with every field the game can put in
one -- equipment, curses, wilds, people, a levelled hero, a half-explored map --
saves it, reads it back and compares the two field by field, recursively.

That is what makes the generic codec safe. It walks dataclasses by reflection
rather than listing fields, so a field added to the game and forgotten by the
codec fails *here* rather than in somebody's saved run twenty minutes in.
