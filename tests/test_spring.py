"""Tests for the cleansing spring and for lifting a curse.

A curse used to be permanent by definition -- "a decision made once and lived
with" -- and half of this file is about the part that is easy to get wrong when
that stops being true: giving back *exactly* what was taken. A wither takes a
quarter of the maximum at the moment it lands, so a spring that recomputes the
fraction on the way out hands back a different number, and one that subtracts
modifiers instead of rebuilding them leaves a floating-point residue on the
hero's speed forever.
