"""Tests for the shop.

Two halves, and they are tested together because they are one feature: the
catalogue (what is on sale, for how much, and what the shop refuses) and the
loadout (what a bought thing actually does once the run starts). A price list
that sells a weapon which does nothing is worse than no shop at all.
