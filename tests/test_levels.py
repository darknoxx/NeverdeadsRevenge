"""Tests for the curve a run climbs.

The whole thing is a function of the kill count, so most of this file reads the
curve off rather than playing it: thresholds, the rotation of what each level
grants, and the arithmetic of a jump of several levels at once. The last few
tests are the integration -- that a kill actually teaches, that what it teaches
survives a descent, and that nothing can take it back.
