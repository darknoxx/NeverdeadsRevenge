"""Tests for the people on the floors.

They carry no mechanics -- no quest, no trade, no reward -- so what there is to
test is everything *around* that: that they never fight, never get fought, never
block the turn queue, never stand on the way out, and never wear a glyph or a
colour that already means something else on the map.

The two uniqueness tests live with the other registries and now include them; the
colour one is in ``test_game.py`` beside the heroes, and the glyph one in
``test_world.py`` beside the tiles.
