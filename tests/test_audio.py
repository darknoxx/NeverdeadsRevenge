"""Tests for the sounds.

Two halves. The files themselves are generated, so they are checked the way the
icon is -- regenerate and compare -- and the playback is checked for the thing
that actually matters about it: that it is **safe**. A machine with no audio must
get silence and no delay, never an error, because a sound effect is not worth a
crash and most machines running a terminal game have no business making noise.

And three invariants that are the whole reason this was rewritten:

* **the device's position is measured, not guessed.** A sound is mixed into a
  buffer whose head is the frame the device is about to play, so the drop
  decision is a comparison between two numbers read off the same buffer the
  sound is inserted into. The version before this scheduled by its own clock
  and dropped by its own guess.
* **a fight is a mixer, not a playlist.** Ten blows a second against sounds of
  a tenth of a second is a queue that runs away, so sounds are added *on top*
  of each other and the buffer's length is bounded by the longest clip rather
  than by how many blows landed. This is the difference between a fight and a
  fight that is three seconds behind itself.
* **bytes land in the order they were queued in**, which is what makes the
  *order* no longer the thing that goes wrong.
