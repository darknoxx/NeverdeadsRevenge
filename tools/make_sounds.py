"""Generate the game's sound effects.

Chiptune, and not only because a terminal roguelite should sound like one: it is
the one kind of music that can be *synthesised exactly*. A Gameboy's two pulse
channels are square waves with a duty cycle and its noise channel is noise, which
between them is `math` and `struct` from the standard library. No samples, no
dependencies, nothing to license, and the files are a few kilobytes each.

    python3 tools/make_sounds.py                 # all of them, into the package
    python3 tools/make_sounds.py --out /tmp/x    # somewhere else
    python3 tools/make_sounds.py --list          # what there is

The test suite regenerates every file and fails if the committed ones disagree,
the same way it does for the icon. Edit the recipes, not the WAVs.
